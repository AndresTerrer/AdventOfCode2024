Personal atempt at compleating this on my spare time.

Repo structure consists of 
- Day_##/ folders to keep each day's data and code
    - test.txt with the short version of the data
    - data.txt with all data for the answer
    - Notebook.ipynb, clear development, testing and text of the quiestons

- Common processing script for reading the data and what not.
- Make_day_folder.py for creating a new folder with the same structure. Call it using  >> python make_fay_folder.py --day < day_number >
